# Javascript Password Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project was to demostrate how javascript could be used to create a interactive password generator using prompts and confirms. I built this project to showcase my current skill with javascript but also to create a very useful application that can be used in our personal lives. I learned how to create functions, how to create arrays, how to create If statements, and how to combine them to create a function that is responsive only when a condition is met.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

To install this application, you need clone the repository. To clone the repository, you go to the green button on the repository that says "< > Code". Then you can choose to copy either the https url or the ssh url if you have a ssh key. After you copy the link, then you go to your terminal on your computer and in the terminal, you change the current directory to the directory you want to place the cloned repository in and then you type "git clone" and paste the url. Finally, you hit enter and the repository will be on your machine and you can open the index.html in your browser by right clicking the html in the directory and choosing which browser to open it in.

## Usage

To use this application, you need to first press on the button that says "Generate Password". This starts the series of prompts and confirms, in which you can interasct with. The first prompt will ask you for the length of the password. The following confirms will allow you to customize the password with uppercase and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. To customize the password, you must hit "Ok" to use that type of character in your password or hit "Cancel" to not use it in your password. After choosing how you want to customize the password, the password will be generated in the box in the middle of the screen and you can copy it from there to use it whenever you want.
